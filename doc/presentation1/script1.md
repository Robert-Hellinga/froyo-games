* what genre or game are you focusing on and what commonalities and differences have you identified
    * Strategy Games
    * Commonalities
        * Two players
        * Can use minimax algo for AI on them
        * Use a grid, players place pieces on said grid
    * Differences
        * Win condition
        * Potential moves
            * Checkers: Diagonal only, jumping
            * Connect4: Gravity, piece falls to bottom of column
            * Othello: Can only place in a position that "outflanks" opponent
* what features (including optional ones) you are planning to work on
    * Home screen that lets you pick which game and what type of opponent
    * Play online with other players
        * Either can put in a name and match with that player to play them, or randomly
    * AI players
    * Start the game over against AI (resets everything in current game)
    * Save the game
        * Saves state of board and whose turn it is, so that game can be resumed later
    * 
* who is expected to work on which parts of the project
* what features you expect to complete during each of the three Sprints
* demo the User Interface Wireframe to show how the user will interact with the program
* demo any working code you have completed during the week

* describe the design and framework goals: what is expected to be flexible/open and what is fixed/closed
* provide an overview of the project's modules: what is each responsible for, how does it depend on other modules, what does it encapsulate, and how can new features be plugged in to it
* describe two APIs in detail:
    * what service does it provide?
    * how does it provide for extension?
    * how does it support users (your team mates) to write readable, well design code?
* describe two Use Cases in detail that show off how to use each of the APIs described above
* describe one alternative design considered and what trade-offs led to it not being chosen
