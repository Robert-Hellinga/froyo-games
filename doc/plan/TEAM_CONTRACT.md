# Example Team Contract

### As a project team, we promise to:
 * respect each other's ideas and work.
 * communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
    * Do work on separate branches to avoid merge conflicts
    * Team members should try to work in separate packages
 * others based on your team discussion

### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
 * have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement.
 * report the issue in the Team Sprint Report.
 * Others based on your team discussion

### Team Procedures:
 * Day, time, and place for regular team meetings (not necessarily with the client)
    * Tuesday/Thursday on Zoom at 10am EST
 * Preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, Facebook, Slack, face-to-face, etc.)
    * iMessage
 * Decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
    * Priority goes to person who wrote the code for code conflicts
    * Majority if there are design conflicts
 * Method for setting and following meeting agendas (how will items get on each agenda? by when? reminders? keeping meetings on track?)
    * Keep in contact via iMessage, if tasks take longer than expected just keep everyone notified
    * Keep everyone in the loop for progress
